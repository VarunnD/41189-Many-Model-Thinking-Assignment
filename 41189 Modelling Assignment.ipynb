    "Social media platforms are growing at an alarming rate, and with the current global pandemic, most jobs and social interactions have been pushed onto an online environment, leading to a surgical increase in online user activity within the past couple of months. This increase has caused significant delays of productivity both related to the limitations and restrictions placed on physical interactions and socialisation especially within Australia’s states and territories (Nguyen, 2020), and also due to the ongoing backlog of users attempting to gain access to electronic resources found within these social media platforms (Estes, 2020). To combat this, it is fundamental to understand and identify key attributes that correlate to the growth of these social media platforms in order to support them better, especially during these times of need. As part of this investigation, three unique models will be used to determine a suitable solution to this ongoing problem, especially since this overall increase in activity was due to the lockdowns of the Coronavirus pandemic. System dynamics, networks, and replicator dynamic models will be used in order to identify key characteristics to not only create and develop a probable solution, but to further assist these social media platforms as efficiently as possible."

    "By supporting the overall growth of these social media platforms, it will allow them to grow and develop their businesses to an extent whereby their values and features will focus more on their target audience rather than running for monetary value, which ultimately brings individuals together through an online webspace. From a mental point of view, by conducting this investigation, it will further assist the mental health of society at a global scale, due to the significant effects of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on physical interactions. Supporting the online ecosystem of major brands such as Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, or Microsoft Teams, will help compensate with advertising, estimating company growth, and support team sizes in order to positively impact individuals and society as a whole, which is ultimately the target goal of this investigation.

We can assume for this topic there are two strategies, a user is apart of the platform or the user is not apart of the platform. Since the strategies are known, the two other key components still need to be assigned. The payoff/fitness can be viewed as the overall value a user will get from either being on or off the platform. This could be impacted by a variety of needs a user has, such as, being able to communicate with family and friends, the ability to share content or even privacy concerns. The overall population breakdown is also needed for this model to accurately represent the growth over time. This will be a breakdown of what percentage of users are following each strategy (on or off the platform). The overall population would be the potential userbase, as it provides a more accurate representation of the potential customers when compared to the world population since it excludes children without technology, people without access to the internet, etc.\n",
